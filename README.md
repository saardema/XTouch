# Motu AVB device MIDI controller

A Python middleware application to allow a MOTU Ultralight Mk4 to be controlled with a Behringer X-Touch Compact MIDI mixer controller.

This is created for personal use but can be modified to be used for different MOTU AVB devices and different MIDI controllers.

Feel free to reach out if you are trying to implement it for your own setup.
